<h2>Professional Experience</h2>

<h3>Pew-it Consulting</h3>
<h4>Owner 2005 - Present</h4>

<p>Architecting creative cloud solutions for organizations.</p>

<p>As a software consultant and contractor, the focus is always relieving a clients' pain quickly.</p>

<p>Creating architectures that quickly solve problems with a concern for future needs and capabilities. Including new
  technologies provide the maximum future opportunity for clients to continue improvement of solutions.</p>
  
<p>Recently worked on a contract to move a $50,000/month infrastructure hosted in RackSpace to Amazon Web Services (aws)
  where the monthly cost was cut 2k. The reliability and disaster recovery options were greatly improved as well. The 
  overall scalability is greatly improved because of use Docker containers and additional serverless 
  microservices created with .NET Core Lambda functions.</p>

<p>The new Lambda-based microservice based API is the future offering for my client as they are moving away from a 
    WinForms client to an API based product offering.</p>

    lab communications tests to be fully automated.</p>

<p>Integrations with partners done with web services allowing partners to be rapidly integrated into to laboratory workflow 
    process at any level.</p>

<p>With limited resources and a compressed timeline, I was able to reduce the scope of deliverables for a minimal viable 
    product that ensured later releases could deliver full-scope capabilities. The interface and services 
    have allowed for fully automated processes between orders from sales and marketing to the laboratory. While ensuring 
    the solution was auditable for full HIPAA compliance.</p>

<h3>Cisco</h3>
<h4>Technical Architect 2015 – 2016</h4>

<p>Worked with Cisco's partner community to integrate systems with Cisco Impact, a partner focused sales tool. The 
    typical integration requires service integration and cloud integration. I also worked extensively on internal

    microservice-based system that can be flexibly operated, monitored, and maintained.</p>

    and systems that improve visibility to the business.</p>

    plans to develop tools that would increase the visibility of progress on metric delivery while providing 
    functionality engaging interface to individual contributors that would ensure data for each metric was collected. 
    Each solution developed to be a readily available cross-platform and device profile using a SaaS model, enabling 
    the overall organization to track, manage, and understand the usage and impact of each solution. Typical solutions 
    used various Azure-based services on ASP.NET using MVC pattern and different application and UI frameworks such
